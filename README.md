# Helix-TTD Proto-AGI v2.1.1

> **Production Tag:** `v2.1.1-PRODUCTION`  
> **Active Research Branch:** `v2.1.1-RESEARCH`

## Overview

Helix-TTD Proto-AGI is a modular research prototype that explores deterministic runtime validation, topological security mechanisms, hybrid key exchange, ledger synchronization, and interface boundary isolation within a phased computational architecture. The repository is organized to separate production-ready components from ongoing research and development.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bk154022/Helix-TTD-Proto-AGI-.git
cd Helix-ProtoAGI-v2.1.1

python -m venv .venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running

Execute individual development phases directly, for example:

```bash
python sections/phase8_release_validation.py
```

or execute any earlier phase as required for validation and testing.

---

## Branch Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `master` | Stable production baseline |
| `v2.1.1-RESEARCH` | Active research and experimental development |
| `development/v2.2` | Future feature development |

---

## Production Release

The repository state validated by the production pipeline is preserved under the Git tag:

```text
v2.1.1-PRODUCTION
```

This tag represents the verified production baseline from which future research branches are derived.
